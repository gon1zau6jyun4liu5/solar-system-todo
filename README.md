5. Let AI estimate the optimal deadline
6. Launch your mission and watch it appear in 3D space

### **AI Classification Examples**
- **"Urgent: Complete quarterly report by Friday"**
  - Category: Work
  - Priority: High
  - Hierarchy: Planet (project)
  - Estimated deadline: This Friday
  
- **"Learn React Three Fiber for better 3D development"**
  - Category: Education
  - Priority: Medium
  - Hierarchy: Sun (major goal)
  - Estimated deadline: 30 days

- **"Send email to client about meeting"**
  - Category: Work
  - Priority: High
  - Hierarchy: Satellite (task)
  - Estimated deadline: Tomorrow

### **Interactive 3D Experience**
- **Task Focus**: Click any todo in the panel to focus on its 3D representation
- **Camera Control**: Watch as camera smoothly tracks to the selected object
- **Orbital View**: Observe how tasks orbit around their parent objects
- **Animation Toggle**: Use the AI panel to pause/resume all animations
- **Zoom Navigation**: Scroll to zoom, drag to explore different solar systems

### **Understanding the Hierarchy**
- **☀️ Suns (Major Goals)**: Long-term objectives, largest and brightest
- **🪐 Planets (Projects)**: Mid-term projects orbiting around goals
- **🛰️ Satellites (Tasks)**: Small, specific actions orbiting projects

## 🤖 AI Classification Categories

| Category | Keywords | Default Priority | Estimated Days |
|----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| 💼 Work | meeting, project, deadline, report, email | High | 7 |
| 🏠 Personal | family, friend, hobby, health, exercise | Medium | 14 |
| 📚 Education | study, learn, course, exam, research | High | 10 |
| 💰 Finance | budget, payment, bill, tax, investment | High | 3 |
| 🏡 Home | clean, repair, cooking, maintenance | Medium | 5 |
| ⚕️ Health | medical, therapy, diet, wellness, fitness | High | 7 |
